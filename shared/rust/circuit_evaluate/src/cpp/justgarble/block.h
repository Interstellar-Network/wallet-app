 * Historically a simple "__m128i Block"
 * But it's better to have a proper class(operators overload, etc)
 *
 * NOTE: the original impl was directly using a __m128i field.
 * This is SLOWER than using 2 uint64! Probably due to the fact that the m128i
 * field is copied everywhere when XORing etc
 * See bench/bench_xor_Block.cpp for comparison.
 *
 * WARNING: Those functions REALLY need to be inline:
 * circuit_display_gen_bench [1000], avg of 5 runs:

 * out of line(in .cpp):  385k circuits/h
