# iOs app

## Dev

### prereq

- install Android Studio(for Mac)
    - NOTE: there is possibly a way to avoid a full install, but we need AT LEAST `gradlew`

### XCode

NOTE: below SHOULD already be set, but double check the value:

- Project settings -> click "+" add "new User defined": `JAVA_HOME`
    - eg `/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/Contents/Home/`(no need for double quotes or escaping)
